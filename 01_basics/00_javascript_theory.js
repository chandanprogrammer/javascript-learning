// -> JavaScript is a clint side scripting language.
// -> It is used to make web page alive.
// -> JavaScript can execute not only in the browser but also on the server
// -> JavaScript was inverted by 'Brendan Eich' in 1995
// -> JavaScript has evolved significantly as a language and is now used to perform a wide variety of tasks.
// -> JavaScript handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

// ---> How to execute JavaScript?
// 1. JavaScript can be executed directly inside the browser console
// 2. Another way to execute JavaScript is with a runtime like NodeJs that can be installed and used to run JavaScript code. 
// 3. Another way to execute JavaScript is to insert it inside the <script> tag of an HTML document.
// Using github codespaces

// JS file ---> Browser ----> executes

// ------> What makes JavaScript unique
// HTML/CSS support
// Simple things (simple API [Application Programming Interface])
// Major modern browser support

// V8 engine is a JavaScript engine
// NodeJs makes in c++ language by 'Ryan Dahl'

// ----> What is ECMAScript ?
// ECMAScript is a standared on which JavaScript is passed. 
// It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are actually talking about the same language.
// JavaScript and ECMAScript can almost always be used interchangeably
// ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard and ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

// -----> JavaScript versions
// ES1 - 1997 [ECMAScript 1st version]
// ES2 - 1998 [ECMAScript 2nd version]
// ES3 - 1999 [ECMAScript 3rd version]
// ES5 - 2009 
// ES6 - 2015 [ECMAScript]
// Yearly version - 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020

// Syntax -> Some set of rules follow during writing a JavaScript program called syntax.  

// Comments --> Sometimes we want our program to contains a text which is not executed by the Js engine, such a text is called comment. Sometimes comments are used to prevent the execution of some lines of code.

// This is single line comment
/* This is multiple line comment */



// Synchronous programming -> Operations are performed one after the other, in sequence. So, basically each line of code waits for the previous one to finish before proceeding to the next. 
    // Example - 
    // console.log("Hi");
    // console.log("Geek");
    // console.log("How are you?");
    

// Asynchronous programming -> Allows multiple tasks to run independently of each other. In asynchronous code, a task can be initiated, and while waiting for it to complete, other tasks can proceed. This non-blocking nature helps improve performance and responsiveness, especially in web applications.
    // Example - 
        // console.log("Hi");

        // setTimeout(() => {
        //     console.log("Geek");
        // }, 2000);

        // console.log("End");
